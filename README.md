# bbSelect
**A package for diverse R-group selection for medicinal chemistry**

**bbSelect** is a tool for selecting a diverse set of R-groups by using information about the placement of pharmacophore features in 3D. It looks to map the available pharmacophore feature placement space in 3D, projecting this to a 2D representation which is then used to drive a partitioning and selection.

## Installation instructions
Mamba can be used to install the enviroment needed to run **bbSelect** using the included environment.yml file.

The following commands can be used to install from fresh from linux, setting up a fresh miniforge (https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)
```
wget -O Miniforge3.sh "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"

bash Miniforge3.sh -b -p "${HOME}/conda"

source "${HOME}/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"

source "${HOME}/conda/etc/profile.d/mamba.sh"

mamba env create -f environment.yml
```

## Usage

>[!TIP]
>Filtering **must** reduce the input set to molecules that would be permissable to select.

The Usage for **bbSelect** is exemplified in the usage_examples directory.\
Its use is demonstrated within jupyter notebooks but can be wrapped up into a python script to run in a more automated fashion.\
The general steps for the use of bbSelect are:

<p align="center"><b>
<br>Get library of molecules<br>
ðŸ ‹<br>
Filter molecules and associate with properties for prioritisation</b><i><br> (See usage_examples/bb_preparation.ipynb)<br><b></i>
ðŸ ‹<br>
Clip molecules or perform R-group decomposition, placing 15CH3 at the attachment point </b><i><br>(Supported in bbSelectBuild.py)<br><b></i>
ðŸ ‹<br>
Generate conformer ensembles </b><i><br>(Supported in bbSelectBuild.py)<br><b></i>
ðŸ ‹<br>
Build bbSelect DB </b><i><br>(bbSelectBuild.py)<br><b></i>
ðŸ ‹<br>
Partition and select R-groups </b><i><br>(bbSelect.py)<br><br><b></i>
</b></p>

>[!WARNING]
>Prioritisation **must** be performed elsewise there is no method for **bbSelect** to determine a selection from a partition.\
>It is recommended to use composite scores (such as MPOs, QED).\
>**bbSelect** selects from the prioritisation values in ascending order, where smallest values are chosen first.

## Settings
Described herein are the main settings for bbSelectBuild and bbSelect\

### bbSelectBuild 
The functions of bbSelect build are wrapped into the self-titled bbSelectBuild class.\
**Main parameters for bbSelectBuild.bbSelectBuild()**\

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| smiles_file | str | - | Path to the smiles file of unclipped molecules, containing the headers `smiles` and `ID` |
| output_root | str | - | Path to desired output file. The bbSelect db will append `.bin` and `.ref` to this root to store the db files |
| cell_size | float | - | The size of the cells in the grid, in Angstroms |
| num_cells | int | - | The number of cells, in the positive x direction, to use in the grid |
| ncpu | int | `0` | Number of CPUs to use in the calculations. Setting to `0` will use all available CPUs |
| rxn_SMARTS | str | - | SMARTS pattern that will transform the full molecule to its clipped representation with [15CH3] at the attachment point|

**Options for bbSelectBuild class using bbSelectBuild.SetOption(option, value)**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| conformer_generation_program | str | `'omega'` | `'rdkit'` or `'omega'` |
| omega_load_command | str | `module load openeye` | bash command used to load the omega program |
| omega_run_command | str | `omega2` | bash command to run the omega program |
| clipped_smiles_file | str | - | Path to clipped smiles file if it has been generated |
| clipped_smiles_file_sep | str | `\t` | Delimiter used in clipped smiles file |
| conformer_sdf | str | - | Path to conformer SDF if already generated|
| aligned_mols_sdf | str | - | Path to aligned conformer SDF if already generated|
| save_aligned_mols_sdf | str | - | Path to store aligned conformer SDF if desired|

>[!WARNING]
>Conformers must be generated on the clipped R-groups, with [15CH3] at the attachment point

### bbSelect
The functions of bbSelect are wrapped into the Picker() class.\
**Main parameters for bbSelect.Picker()**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ref_file | str | -| Path to the .ref bbSelect db file |
| bin_file | str | -| Path to the .bin bbSelect db file |
| n | int | - | Number of compounds to select |
| method | str | `classic` | `som`, `classic`, or `full_coverage` |
| pharmacophores | str | `*` | Comma separated list of pharmacophore to select from. `*` selects from all available |
| ncpu | str | - | Nuumber of CPUs to utilise|
| sort | str | - | Which value from the input smiles to use for prioritisation. Multiple sort orders can be configured with a comma-separated list|
| tanimoto | float | `0.9` | Tanimoto threshold for selections. Set to `0` to skip this|
| use_coverage | bool | `False` | Whether to force that selections increase coverage|
| flat_som | bool | `False` | Whether to transform all values to the SOM as 1. When False, values will be transformed to log base2|
| multiplier | float | `1` | Multiplier to transform values to the SOM|
